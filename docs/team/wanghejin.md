### Project: BandConnect++
BandConnect++ helps musicians manage contact with other musicians to easily form a band of their preference. It is optimised for CLI users so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#/widget/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22&chartGroupIndex=76&chartIndex=4)


* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Enhanced GUI to include an extra band panel
  * Modified `findb` command to take in string as parameter instead of index
  * Modified `ModelManager` and relevant commands so as to synchronize musician and band panels and make UI more intuitive for users.
